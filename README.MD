The code starts by importing the necessary modules and defining a function to validate URLs using the validators library.

The parse_html function is responsible for parsing the HTML content of a webpage and extracting links. It takes a URL as input.

Inside the parse_html function:

The URL is parsed using urlparse from the urllib.parse module. If the URL doesn't have a scheme (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), it adds the "http://" scheme by default.
The requests.get function is used to make a GET request to the URL, and the response is obtained.
If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful response), the HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library.
Links are extracted from <a> tags' href attributes using a list comprehension and added to the links list.
Additionally, a loop iterates through all HTML tags and their attributes. If an attribute value is a string and a valid URL, it is added to the links list.
The base_url is used to resolve relative links, and the urljoin function is used to convert relative links to absolute links.
The function returns a list of absolute links found in the HTML content.
The save_valid_links and save_broken_links functions are responsible for saving the extracted links to files based on their validity.

The save_valid_links function takes a list of links and a filename. It opens the file in append mode and writes each valid link to a new line in the file.
The save_broken_links function takes a list of links and a filename. It opens the file in append mode and writes each broken (invalid) link to a new line in the file.
In the main part of the code:

The script uses the argparse module to parse command-line arguments. It expects a single optional argument -url to specify the URL directly.
If the -url argument is provided, the URL is assigned to the url variable. Otherwise, the user is prompted to enter a URL.
If the URL doesn't start with a scheme (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), the code adds the "http://" scheme by default.
The parse_html function is called with the URL, and the returned links are stored in the parsed_links variable.
The valid links are saved to the file "valid_links.txt" using the save_valid_links function, and the broken links are saved to the file "broken_links.txt" using the save_broken_links function.
Finally, a success message is printed.
