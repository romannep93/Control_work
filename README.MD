It imports the necessary libraries: argparse for command-line argument parsing, requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and validators for URL validation.

The validate_url function is defined to check if a URL is valid using the validators library.

The parse_html function is defined to parse the HTML page. It takes a URL as input.

The URL is parsed using urlparse to obtain the base URL. If the scheme is missing, it is set to 'http' by default.

A GET request is made to the URL using requests. If the response status code is not 200 (OK), the URL is considered broken and appended to the "broken_links.txt" file. The function then returns.

If the response status code is 200, the HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.

All anchor tags (<a>) in the HTML are retrieved using find_all('a').

The links are extracted from the anchor tags. If the link's href attribute or the link text itself starts with "http://" or "https://", it is considered a valid link and added to the list of valid links. Otherwise, it is considered broken.

The valid links are appended to the "valid_links.txt" file, and the broken links are appended to the "broken_links.txt" file.

The main function is defined to handle command-line arguments. It uses argparse to parse the URL argument if provided or prompts the user to enter the URL.

If the URL doesn't start with "http://" or "https://", it is prefixed with "http://".

The parse_html function is called with the URL.

Finally, when the code execution is complete, it prints the message "Process completed successfully."
