It imports necessary libraries and modules, including argparse for command-line argument parsing, re for regular expressions, requests for making HTTP requests, PdfReader from PyPDF2 for reading PDF files, BeautifulSoup from bs4 for HTML parsing, and logging for logging messages.

It configures the logging module to write log messages to the "link_checker.log" file.

The validate_url(url) function sends a HEAD request to the specified URL and checks if the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request).

The get_valid_links(url) function retrieves all the valid links from the specified URL by making a GET request and parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. It returns a list of valid links.

The validate_links(links) function takes a list of links and validates each link by sending a HEAD request. It categorizes the links into two lists: valid_links and invalid_links based on the response status code. It returns both lists.

The save_to_file(valid_links, invalid_links) function saves the valid_links and invalid_links to separate files named "valid_links.txt" and "broken_links.txt", respectively. It writes each link on a new line in the corresponding file.

The parse_html(url) function is responsible for processing HTML links. It calls get_valid_links(url) to retrieve the links, validates them using validate_links(links), and saves them to files using save_to_file(valid_links, invalid_links).

The PDFLinkChecker class is defined, which takes a PDF file as input during initialization. It has an extract_links() method that extracts all the links from the PDF file using regular expressions and returns them as a list. It also has a process_links() method that processes the extracted links by sending HEAD requests to validate them and writes the valid and broken links to separate files.

The if __name__ == '__main__': block handles command-line arguments using argparse. If no arguments are provided, it prompts the user to enter a URL and a path to a PDF file. If arguments are provided, it uses them directly.

Depending on the command-line arguments, it calls the parse_html(url) function or creates an instance of PDFLinkChecker with the specified PDF file and calls its process_links() method.
